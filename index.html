				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>Hello and welcome to my site! My name is Richard Palmer, and I am currently a senior at Iowa State University. I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Business. Through my work in and outside of University I have gained a good working knowledge of object-oriented programming/design with Java. As well as general knowledge in a variety of other languages including C++, C#, HTML/CSS, Javascript, and lately have been experimenting with Python and the Flask framework.</p>
				<p>
				When I am not coding or tinkering with new technologies I enjoy spending time with family and the family dogs Huxley and Ella. Some of my other hobbies include gaming, skiing in the winter, and golfing when it gets warm again. I have a passion for helping others, and hope to be able to apply my skills in that direction.
				</p>
