				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>Hello! My name is Richard Palmer and this is my site. I am currently a senior at Iowa State University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Business. Through my coursework I have gained general knowledge in a variety of programming languages including C++, C#, and Python, but I find myself most comfortable in Java.</p>
				<p>
				When I am not coding or tinkering with new technologies I am most likely spending time with family and the family dogs Huxley and Ella. Some of my other hobbies include gaming, skiing in the winter, and golfing when it gets warm again. You also might find me cheering for the Chicago Blackhawks and more recently jamming on the ukulele.
				</p>
